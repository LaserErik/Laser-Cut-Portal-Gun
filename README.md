# Laser-Cut-Portal-Gun
Here are all of the files and details on how to build my laser cut portal gun. 

An illustrated construction guide is at:

Specific components used:
Sparkfun - http://sfe.io/w122873
Adafruit - http://www.adafruit.com/wishlists/394599
The wooden pieces are precisely fitted to these parts, so be careful if using alternate versions.

You'll also need two different diameters of brass pipe:
4" OD, 3.75" ID: 2" total length.
2.5" OD, 2.37" ID: 4" total length.  (ID is a bit flexible on this one only).
I bought these from online-metals.com

The .pcb file can be used to order a custom circuit board from Express PCB. Or, you can just look at it to figure out the connections.  ExpressPCB only ships boards in one size, so once you receive the board simply cut it down to size.  The large holes function as perforations.  The small gird in the center of the board has no explicit purpose, I left it as a place to solder in any future components.

To make the project go, load the *.WAV files onto a properly formatted SD card, and load the .ino file into the Arduino.
Solder everything together and fire it up!
