# Laser-Cut-Portal-Gun
Here are all of the files and details on how to build my laser cut portal gun. 

An illustrated construction guide is at:

Specific components used: (Sparkfun - http://sfe.io/w122873) and (Adafruit - http://www.adafruit.com/wishlists/394599). The wooden pieces are precisely fitted to these parts, so be careful if using alternate versions.

You'll need two different diameters of brass pipe: 4" OD, 3.75" ID: 2" total length  and 2.5" OD, 2.37" ID: 4" total length.  (ID is a bit flexible on the smaller pipe). I bought these from online-metals.com


The .pcb file can be used to order a custom circuit board from Express PCB. Or, you can just look at it to figure out the connections.  ExpressPCB only ships boards in one size, so once you receive the board you need to cut part of the board away so it fits the arduino.  Here, the large holes function as perforations.  The small grid in the center of the board has no explicit purpose, I left it as a place to solder in any future components.

To make the project go, load the *.WAV files onto a properly formatted SD card, and load the .ino file into the Arduino.
Solder everything together and fire it up!
